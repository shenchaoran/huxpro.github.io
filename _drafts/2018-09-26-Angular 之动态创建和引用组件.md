**entryComponents**
> Though the @NgModule decorator has an entryComponents array, most of the time you won't have to explicitly set any entry components because Angular adds components listed in @NgModule.bootstrap and those in route definitions to entry components automatically. Though these two mechanisms account for most entry components, if your app happens to bootstrap or **dynamically load a component by type imperatively**, you must add it to entryComponents explicitly.
